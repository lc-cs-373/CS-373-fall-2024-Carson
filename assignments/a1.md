# Question 3

This grammar rule will result in a Java class called `Goo` that extends the base class `blah`. Because the grammar rule uses the nonterminals `VAR` and `silly`, the constructor for the class will take these as arguments.

```java
public Goo(VAR var, Silly silly)
```

# Question 4

Since the rule takes multiple occurances of nonterminals `rule`, `of`, and `stuff` it will take a list of each of these types

```java
public Many(List<Rule> ruleList, List<Of> ofList, List<Stuff> stuffList)
```

# Question 5

This grammar rule takes a fixed number of occurances (3). As such, the class constructor will have a parameter for each

```java
public Classes(CSIT c1, CSIT c2, CSIT c3)
```

# Question 6

```
<var> ::= TOKEN <foo>
```
